# OS.js on Node

Just start a server like noted in the INSTALL.md file.

You can install [node supervisor](https://github.com/petruisfan/node-supervisor) and the development (dist-dev) server will automatically reload on change.

## Running behind a webserver

You can use nginx to run behind a webserver to increase performance and security using a *reverse proxy*.

### nginx

See the included [nginx-node](https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/blob/master/doc/configs/nginx-node.conf) configuration file (for a very basic example)

### apache

First you need to make sure these modules are enabled:

```
sudo a2enmod proxy
sudo a2enmod proxy_http
```

See the included [apache-node](https://github.com/os-js/OS.js/blob/master/doc/configs/apache-node.conf) configuration file (for a very basic example)

## HTTP/2

Create your certificates and place them in `src/server/` (as ex "server.key" and "server.crt"):

```

npm install http2
grunt config:set --name=server.http.mode --value=http2
grunt config:set --name=server.http.cert.name --value=server
grunt config

```
